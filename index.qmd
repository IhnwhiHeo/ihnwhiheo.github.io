### Bio

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics at the University of California, Merced. I expect to receive my doctorate by May 2026, with a dissertation titled *Advanced Methods for Implementation of Bayesian Growth Mixture Modeling*, extramurally funded by the American Psychological Association and the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology.

My overarching research goal is to advance flexible modeling approaches for complex data in the social and behavioral sciences. I specialize in Bayesian inference, latent variable modeling, and missing data. With these specializations, I integrate quantitative, computational, and machine learning methods to develop, evaluate, and implement innovative statistical approaches that expand their applicability across diverse research contexts. More details can be found in the [Program of Research](#program-of-research).

As of September 2025, I have published 11 peer-reviewed journal articles, including 7 as first author, in flagship methodological and applied journals. A complete list of my refereed journal publications can be found on the [Articles](articles.qmd) page. For additional details on my academic training and experience, please see my [curriculum vitae](Ihnwhi Heo CV Current.pdf).


### Education

#### University of California, Merced, USA
Ph.D. in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics, 2026

#### Utrecht University, The Netherlands
M.Sc. in Methodology and Statistics (Cum Laude), 2021

#### Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea

### Program of Research

My program of research can be detailed with three lines.

#### (1) Bayesian Data Science for Statistical Modeling and Theory Construction

I develop and evaluate Bayesian methods for structural equation models, latent growth models, and mixture models to advance theory construction and statistical modeling. 

#### (2) Missing Data Science for Practical Applications and Valid Inference

I examine the impact of missing data on statistical inference and develop imputation techniques using computational and machine learning approaches for handling missing data

#### (3) Collaborative Data Science for Interdisciplinary Impact

I translate methodological innovations into practice by applying them to empirical data and by disseminating them across academic communities, guided by the philosophy of open science.
