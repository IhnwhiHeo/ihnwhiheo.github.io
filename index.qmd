### Bio

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics at the University of California, Merced. I expect to receive my doctorate by May 2026, with a dissertation titled *Advanced Methods for Implementation of Bayesian Growth Mixture Modeling*, extramurally funded by the American Psychological Association and the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology.

My overarching research goal is to advance flexible modeling approaches for complex data in the social and behavioral sciences. I specialize in Bayesian inference, latent variable modeling, and missing data. 

With these specializations, I integrate quantitative, computational, and machine learning approaches to develop, evaluate, and implement innovative statistical methods that expand their applicability across diverse research contexts. More details can be found in the [Program of Research](#program-of-research).

As of September 2025, I have published 11 peer-reviewed journal articles, including 7 as first author, in flagship methodological and applied journals. A complete list of my refereed journal publications can be found on the [Articles](articles.qmd) page. For additional details on my academic training and experience, please see my [curriculum vitae](Ihnwhi Heo CV Current.pdf).


### Education

#### University of California, Merced, USA
Ph.D. in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics, 2026

#### Utrecht University, The Netherlands
M.Sc. in Methodology and Statistics (Cum Laude), 2021

#### Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea
B.A. in Psychology (Highest Honors), 2019


### Program of Research

My program of research can be detailed with three lines.

#### (1) Bayesian Data Science for Statistical Modeling

I advance Bayesian methodology for latent variable models, including structural equation models, growth curve models, and mixture models. My research examines Bayesian estimation and evaluation of these models and integrates computational methods to extend the latent variable modeling framework through Bayesian regularization and Bayesian model averaging.

#### (2) Missing Data Science for Practical Applications

In social and behavioral research, incomplete data are the norm rather than the exception. My work in this research program has two goals: first, to understand how missingness affects parameter estimation and model evaluation; and second, to develop and evaluate computational and machine learning methods that ‚Äúfill in‚Äù missing values in ways that support practical applications in real research contexts.

#### (3) Collaborative Data Science for Interdisciplinary Impact

I collaborate with applied and methodological researchers across disciplines to translate methodological innovations into practice and to maximize interdisciplinary impact. These collaborations create synergies that generate novel applications and foster unique contributions at the intersection of disciplines.
