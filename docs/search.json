    "text": "Bio\nI am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics at the University of California, Merced. I firmly believe that scientific discovery is a dynamic process, driven by the continuous updating of scientific knowledge through experiential learning. This perspective closely aligns with the philosophical paradigm of Bayesian inference. For additional details on my academic training and experience, please see my curriculum vitae.\n\n\nProgram of Research\n\n(1) Bayesian methodology for theory construction and statistical modeling\nI develop and evaluate Bayesian methods (e.g., model averaging, model evaluation, regularization, estimation, and hypothesis testing) for latent variable models, including structural equation models, latent (e.g., piecewise) growth models, and mixture models.\n\n\n(2) Practical and computational approaches to missing data science\nI examine the consequences of missing data for model estimation and evaluation, and I develop multiple imputation techniques using modern data science tools, including machine learning and deep learning algorithms, for use in latent variable models.\n\n\n(3) Application, dissemination, and collaborative use of quantitative methods\nI communicate and collaborate with methodological and applied researchers by writing tutorial papers for educational and school psychologists, partnering with social and health psychologists to investigate stress and mental health mechanisms, and proposing new psychometric or statistical frameworks for longitudinal, categorical, or social network data. I have also authored multiple statistical tutorials for \\(\\texttt{R}\\), \\(\\texttt{JASP}\\), and \\(\\texttt{jamovi}\\) aimed at applied researchers.\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nUniversity of California, Merced, USA\nPh.D. in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics, 2026 (Expected)\n\n\nUtrecht University, The Netherlands\nM.Sc. in Methodology and Statistics, 2021\n\n\nSungkyunkwan University, South Korea\nB.A. in Psychology, 2019\n\n\n\nSelected Awards\n\nSMEP Dissertation Research Grant\nSociety of Multivariate Experimental Psychology, 2025\n\n\nNomination for Open Science Award\nOpen Science Community Utrecht, 2024\n\n\nGraduate Student Opportunity Program Fellowship\nUniversity of California, Merced, 2022–2023"
