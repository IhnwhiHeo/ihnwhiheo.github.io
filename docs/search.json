    "text": "Bio\nI am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics at the University of California, Merced. I expect to receive my doctorate by May 2026, with a dissertation titled Advanced Methods for Implementation of Bayesian Growth Mixture Modeling, extramurally funded by the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP).\nMy overarching research goal is to advance flexible modeling approaches for complex data in the social and behavioral sciences. I specialize in Bayesian inference, latent variable modeling, and missing data. With these specializations, I integrate quantitative, computational, and machine learning approaches to develop, evaluate, and implement innovative statistical methods that expand their applicability across diverse research contexts. More details can be found in the Program of Research.\nAs of September 2025, I have published 12 peer-reviewed journal articles, including 7 as first author, in top-tier methodological and applied journals. A complete list of my refereed journal publications can be found on the Articles page. For additional details on my academic training and experience, please see my curriculum vitae.\n\n\nEducation\n\nUniversity of California, Merced, USA\nPh.D. in Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics, 2026\n\n\nUtrecht University, The Netherlands\nM.Sc. in Methodology and Statistics (Cum Laude), 2021\n\n\nSungkyunkwan University, South Korea\nB.A. in Psychology (Highest Honors), 2019\n\n\n\nProgram of Research\nMy program of research can be detailed with three lines.\n\n(1) Bayesian Inference for Statistical Modeling\nI advance Bayesian methodology for latent variable models, including structural equation models, growth curve models, and mixture models. My research examines Bayesian estimation and evaluation of these models and integrates computational methods for Bayesian regularization and Bayesian model averaging.\n\n\n(2) Missing Data Analysis for Practical Applications\nI examine the impact of missingness on statistical modeling and develop computational and machine learning approaches for handling missing data, with the goal of supporting practical applications in research.\n\n\n(3) Methodology-Driven Collaboration for Interdisciplinary Impact\nI collaborate with researchers across disciplines to create synergies that translate methodological innovations into practice, generate novel applications, and foster contributions at the intersection of disciplines.\n\n\n\nSelected Awards\n\nPsychological Sciences Dissertation Fellowship\nUniversity of California, Merced, 2025\n\n\nAPA Dissertation Research Award\nAmerican Psychological Association, 2025\n\n\nSMEP Dissertation Research Grant\nSociety of Multivariate Experimental Psychology, 2025\n\n\nNomination for Open Science Award\nOpen Science Community Utrecht, 2024\n\n\nGraduate Student Opportunity Program Fellowship\nUniversity of California, Merced, 2022–2023"
