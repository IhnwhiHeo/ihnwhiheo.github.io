I firmly believe that scientific discovery is a dynamic process, driven by the continuous updating of scientific knowledge through experiential learning. This perspective closely aligns with the philosophical paradigm of Bayesian inference.\nMotivated by this view, my research aims to advance flexible modeling approaches for complex data in psychology and, more broadly, in the social and behavioral sciences. As detailed in the Program of Research, I specialize in Bayesian methods, missing data techniques, and latent variable modeling.\nA complete list of my refereed journal publications related to these research areas can be found on the Articles page.
